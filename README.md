The difference between [comment-down](https://atom.io/packages/comment-down) package and this package is that this package saves the cursor position but overload standard keybinding (ctrl|cmd-/) while [comment-down](https://atom.io/packages/comment-down) adds a hook that moves the cursor on the next line after toggling a built-in command.
